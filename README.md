# PowerBI-Learning

This repository documents my hands-on learning and practice with Power BI, developed as part of my data analytics portfolio using a [publicly available dataset](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdCltDhmRLo&t=67s).

Key skills and features demonstrated:

• Data transformation and cleaning using Power Query

• Data modeling using Table View and Model View

• Creation of calculated columns and measures using DAX

• Building interactive dashboards with meaningful KPIs and visualizations

• Applying best practices for data relationships and schema design

Project contents:

• Source CSV files used for data ingestion and transformation

• Power BI (.pbix) file containing the full data model, DAX logic, and dashboard

• PNG dashboard screenshots for quick preview of insights and visuals

This project focuses on translating raw data into actionable insights through effective data modeling, DAX calculations, and clear visual storytelling using Power BI.
